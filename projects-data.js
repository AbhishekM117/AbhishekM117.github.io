        subtitle: "NLP & Deep Learning",
        image: "./assets/sms-icon.png",
        description: "This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detecting spam in SMS messages. Key elements include feature extraction with TF-IDF and Word2vec, comparing Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and LSTM deep learning models. By leveraging TF-IDF with SVM, we achieved a high detection accuracy (98.2%), while LSTM and RNN models offered insights into sequential patterns and generated spam-like text for synthetic data applications.",
